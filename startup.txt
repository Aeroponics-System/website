Structure
	-Structure the seperate boards into individual functions
	main board:
		-handles all the heavy lifting
		-generates the reports and exports them to the sd card
		-uses an rp2040 as main controller
		-gets data from other baords using i2c
		- have generic screen for displaying data
		-can have screen have dashbaord, potentially uopgrade to pi zero
		if it gets too complex for rp2040 to handle

	sub-boards:
		-handles the sub tasks
		-this includes temeprature capturing
		-water dispersion
		-ph testing
		-temperature of water capturing
		-heating and cooling of envirment and/or water
		-100% use rp2040 or smaller chip if easily integrated with the boards

	Webiste:
		-use react and next to create the site
		-somewhat interactive that introduces the process and the goals
		-open about the process and some of the source material, some code and schematics
